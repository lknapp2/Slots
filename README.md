# Slots
This is a modified version of a slot machine, originally created for my Advanced C++ final project. Note that, because this was a school project, a few aspects that were "instructor preference" do not necessarily reflect my general coding/commenting practice. For example, the teacher preferred us to use global variables as much as possible - not because they are better, but because they were easier for him to grade. Additionally, my comments are typically more concise & frequent instead of giant blocks of text found in this assignment. Also, the combination of his "absolutely no hard-coding" rule with his aforementioned global variable rule led to some inelegant workarounds, especially in loops, that I would handle differently now.
